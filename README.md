## Getting help
* `help`. For instance, `help(len)`, or `help(tuple.index)` for known functions or methods.
* `dir`. For instance, `dir(list)` for all methods for lists.

## Basic functions
* `type` for getting the data type of the object in Python.

## Comparison
* My Gist [comparison.py](https://gist.github.com/corytu/c4fbd7c330c8a33c45965c5cad16ab38) demonstrates the difference between `==` and `is`. Besides I mention `pd.DataFrame.equals` there for comparing DataFrames.

## Functions for programming
* `lambda`s are Python's way of creating anonymous functions. This is unlike R. "You declare a lambda function with the word `lambda` followed by a list of arguments, followed by a colon and then a single expression and this is key. There's only one expression to be evaluated in a lambda. The expression value is returned on execution of the lambda." Click [here](Defining_functions_in_R_and_Python.md) for detailed comparison of R and Python.

## Functions do loops or parallel operations
* `map` is kind of like `sapply` in R. See [defining functions in R and Python](Defining_functions_in_R_and_Python.md) for an example.

## Stack Overflow articles
* [Create list with numbers between 2 values](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18265935/python-create-list-with-numbers-between-2-values)
