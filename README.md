## Getting help
* `help`. For instance, `help(len)`, or `help(tuple.index)` for known attributes.
* `dir`. For instance, `dir(list)` for all attributes for lists.

## Basic functions
* `type` for getting the data type of the object in Python.

## Functions for programming in Python
* `lambda`s are Python's way of creating anonymous functions. This is unlike R. "You declare a lambda function with the word `lambda` followed by a list of arguments, followed by a colon and then a single expression and this is key. There's only one expression to be evaluated in a lambda. The expression value is returned on execution of the lambda." Click [here](Defining_functions_in_R_and_Python.md) for detailed comparison of R and Python.

## Functions do loops or parallel operations
* `map` is kind of like `sapply` in R. See [split_title_and_name](split_title_and_name.py) for an example.
